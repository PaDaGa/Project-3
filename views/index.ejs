        <p>is a place to search multiple databases at once to find where a movie is being streamed online.

        How often do you think of a movie to watch and then have to search to find if it's on Hulu or Amazon or Netflix?  Wouldn't you love to have a place where you could search multiple databases all at once?  How about storing a list of movies to watch in the future so you don't have to go through an exhausting search each time you want to watch a movie?</p>
