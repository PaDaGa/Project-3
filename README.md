###DESCRIPTION
__MovieFindr__ is a place to search multiple databases at once to find where a movie is being streamed online.

How often do you think of a movie to watch and then have to search to find if it's on Hulu or Amazon or Netflix?  Wouldn't you love to have a place where you could search multiple databases all at once?  How about storing a list of movies to watch in the future so you don't have to go through an exhausting search each time you want to watch a movie?

###APPROACH TAKEN
Team PaDaGa's approach in building this app was to start off with a Node.js framework using Express for our server side and MongoDB for our database management.  

We divided up the project so that each team member took the lead role as follows:

  Team Leader  | Role
  -----------  | ----------
  Paul         | GitHub Master, Scrum Master
  Darin        | Design Master
  Gaye         | Documentation Master, Database Management

###MVP
* Have a working Google OAuth for users to log on and log off
* Allow users to be able to search, create, edit, update and delete their movie list (full CRUD)
* Allow users to see which providers are showing the movies
* Allow users to check which movies they have watched
